# Hello, World

This is my blog. Well, not [the literal one you can read][jt]. This is what makes [the one you can read][jt]. I'm making it with the help of the Gatsby starter theme, a static site generator. [The one you can read][jt] is hosted on Github pages and is my playground for learning how to build useful things for the web.
