Well, it is that time again. A new year is upon us. Many of us will start preparing by finding our list from last year which contains all those resolutions we did not keep.

You know the list, right? Looks a little something like this I imagine:

#### 1. Lose weight

#### 2. Eat healthy

#### 3. Study more

#### 4. Treat people better
Etc…

Before we waste money on the gym membership that will be collecting dust by February 1st, let us make sure we are reminded of a couple of things.

Culturally, many of us find ourselves making New Year’s resolutions. Soon we will begin hearing talk and seeing posts about the changes people are planning to make come January 1st. The reality is, with each new day we are presented with an unrivaled opportunity to get it right.

>The reality is, with each new day we are presented with an unrivaled opportunity to get it right.

We do not have to wait for a new year. Think about it this way. Why wait to start eating healthy? Why wait to implement a schedule to optimize your productivity? Why wait to take action on your goals? Waiting leads to procrastination and procrastination to excuses. Let’s save ourselves the trouble of being let down.

We must be careful not to fall into the cultural hype of making a New Year’s resolution. Let’s start making changes in our lives today. Wherever we are, right now is the time. Not January 1st. Seize the opportunity presented with actions that are intentional. Otherwise, we may find ourselves at the beginning of another new year where things are still the same.
