It is far-fetched to assume we actually have the ability to achieve maximum potential on our own.

All throughout history, regardless of the particular study, we see and hear tales of those who achieved remarkable things which benefitted the greater good. More often than not, these individuals had someone who invested in them.

Athletic coaches come to mind as some who have an opportunity for influence that is hard to match. No matter where we are in life we can benefit from the experience and insight of those wiser than us. This does not necessarily mean the flow is always older individuals coaching/mentoring those younger. **The process can go both ways, and rightly should.**

The importance of having a mentor lies in the mentee having an open and willing desire to grow and learn from someone else. This is not something that can be forceful and effective at the same time. Personally, I believe anyone with goals should have a mentor. Someone who is trustworthy and possesses experience in our areas of focus.

I like how [Chris Classic](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2857530/ "Chris Classic") put it when he said,

>“To me, mentoring is crucial in this day and age. We read reviews of restaurants and products before we buy, so why wouldn’t you want to hear advice, reviews, and guidance from someone who embarked on your journey?”

Aside from acknowledging the need, selecting a coach/mentor may prove to be the most difficult. It is also important to remember that not everyone will have our best interest in mind. Sometimes their motives are against seeing us improve.

The best approach is through intentional observance and interaction over a period of time. We, as people have the uncanny inability to hide who we truly are, even when we purposely attempt to. It is amazing the things we can learn from each other through the proper amount of exposure. Either the potential mentor or mentee is capable of taking on this responsibility.

>“We can go farther when we go together!”

Point is, be you. Know yourself and just **“keep it 100”**. During this walk of life, if given enough time, we will come into contact with individuals who we can feel comfortable filling this role. We have to remain focused on the fact that we don’t know all the answers. We are all limited and in need of help.

Peace & Love
