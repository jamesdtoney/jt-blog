The Mortal Kombat video game series is one of my favorites. From the early versions right up to the newest options available, the game never ceases to engage with it's high-powered, intriguing characters and gameplay.

Whether playing inStory Mode or Arcade, the challenge was always an adrenaline rush and nothing was better than winning a match - other than successfully completing a Fatality move. In this move, your character performs an orchestrated attack that is essentially fatal to the opponent. Not just winning but winning in fashion, leaving no question who the winner is. The concept of Mortal Kombat is that you are a character in this fictional fighting championship. Whether in story or arcade mode, there is a similar line of fighting your way through all the other characters until you beat them all. Each win advances the ability of the next opponent, making each match increasingly difficult. Upon successful completion of all matches, you are declared the Mortal Kombat champion and can begin again.

We face a very similar line in our lives as believers in Jesus Christ. We are reminded of this by Paul in the New Testament letter of Ephesians, Chapter 6, Verse 12. We are very much in a cosmic Mortal Combat with our enemies, the demonic hosts of Satan, who are constantly assembled and ready to keep us from making our way to Eternity, winning the ultimate championship.

Each character in Mortal Kombat is equipped with a set of distinct skills and abilities that provide them the capability of defeating each of the adversaries, if used properly. In the same way, Paul calls us to understand our uniqueness in Christ and equip ourselves with the Gospel driven armor that the we have been granted acces to in this battle for life. We must remain mindful of the incoming of these enhanced arrows, ones that contains fire and are capable of destroying much more than a single arrow ever could. Deceitful lies that tell us we are not good enough or we are not smart enough. God's truth will protect and carry us through these battles but only if we equip ourselves properly.

Each character in Mortal Kombat has a breadth of experience and training to work from and so do we. It may not be *our* experience or training but we have access to a God who created and knows all. A God who desires to reveal himself to us and allow us to partake in the joy that is knowing him, fully. Only through prayer and intentional focus and awareness that the enemy is active and ready for the next battle. The question becomes are we?

###So what?

It can be difficult to push through the lies and schemes that we are faced with on a daily basis. Whether they be intrenally or externally initiated. Making a concious effort to recognize our situations for what they truly are by carefully scrutinizing them against God's truth will allow God to strengthen us and guide us to take each battle as it comes, properly prepared and ready to deliver a Fatality to our opponent, the Devil. Stay in communication with Him, trust Him with all you have and he will guide you to the true winner's circle.

**It's time for the next battle, fight!**
