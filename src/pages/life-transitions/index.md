Over the last few of years I have found myself between the Rock and a hard place. Lots of change (much of it unexpected) in regards to personal maturity, family growth, vocational impact and life in general. The biggest challenge has been the fence riding on whether or not to launch out on my own and fully embrace the entrepreneurial (tent maker) spirit that essentially burns in us all.

>My experiences have taught me that we must be careful not to **bite the hand that feeds us**. Literally and figuratively.

Although it can be draining at times, I am thankful to have a skill set that translates well into the fairly secure, digital workforce. It also allows me the opportunity to serve others using the technological gifts, talents and abilities I have been blessed with to help further causes greater than myself. I often still feel like I am under-performing or rather running in Lane 8.

After a few life altering events in the latter part of 2010 I began working to zero in on my zone of genius or my unique core skills and abilities. My goal (and deepest desire) is to find the medium where God has been gracious enough to give me the most skill and passion for effective Kingdom building.  And to use that platform for encouragement through, education on and implementation with the use of digital technologies to positively impact our world in a bigger way than I could ever begin to imagine.

Failed attempts to get myself there under my own strength and understanding have proven worthless time and time again.

I recognize continued growth is necessary. In fact, the process is where so many fall off. We’re impatient beings. It is simply my prayer that God grants me the strength to diligently and intentionally seek Him so the revelations are properly discerned and carried out for His glory.

I will attempt to, in no particular order, decipher some of what I encounter and have encountered in my journey, mostly for myself but given our technological advancements it may be beneficial to someone else as well.

So, let me formally welcome you to my world! It may not be pretty but that’s the point. Gives us the optimism to focus on the bigger picture. Not just our limited time on this rock.

The goals my family has laid out for this year will push the limits farther than normal. I’m feeling the pressures of both nervousness and excitement of what is in store!
