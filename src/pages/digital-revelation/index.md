Let’s say you are reading one of your favorite books. You know, the one you just can’t put down and always end up reading again and again. Suddenly, you realize what you are reading, from your favorite book, the book you’ve read multiple times, shows something that you never noticed before. This something **changes your perspective** of the entire book.

More often than not, when I am reading or studying, I am surprised at how content that I may have heard or read multiple times, suddenly **reveals a new truth**. I have also had this same moment of enlightenment while working with familiar programming tasks. Functions I am very used to working with reveals things that propel me on a new thought pattern or remind me of an absolute that may have been tucked away for a time, simply based on the need of the project. Like a door that provides access to a new area. It exists but must be opened.

I have experienced this principle numerous times while communicating digital technology services and solutions. Many of the clients I help have a basic idea of what they are needing. Once they get their initial questions answered, more questions are usually generated. These additional questions are not new but rather have had their existence revealed. This is what I like to refer to as **digital revelation**. This is where I work to use the skills I have been afforded and gained over the past 10 years to assist with revealing or exposing a specific client’s digital needs.

>The thoughts in our minds don’t just come out. We have to choose to share the information.

Often, we may not necessarily possess the ability to articulate it without a little assistance. This is especially true for technologically advanced situations.

Using the technologies at our disposal and our understanding of them, the creation of an approach that is user focused first, based on the specific client project goals is possible.

Digital know-how and our God-given talents and abilities can assist us with comprehending these digital revelations more clearly. Creating a stable platform for implementation success.

If we are going to be the digital leaders we strive to be, we must work to ask the right questions. Bringing out these additional questions from management, colleagues and clients. Let’s maintain our focus on maximizing digital impact so measurable digital growth can occur.
