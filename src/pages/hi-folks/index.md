I think I heard somewhere before that it is *always* best to start at the beginning. So, let's do just that.

####80's Baby

Born in Bassett, Virginia I was raised in a Christian home with my younger sister by my mother. When I was not able to get outside, I was most content drawing, mostly random comic book characters for my fictional series or playing with tinker toys, legos or things I found during my "by the creek" journeys. I was obsessed with sports and truly believed, at one point, that I'd become a professional athlete.

####Love for Learning

I have always been ok at math (you may laugh but I still do a lot of counting on my fingers while visualizing the dot plates I learned from) but the classical sciences were not of much interest to me. Musically, I always wanted to learn to play the drums and my ear/hand/head cooperation seemed good. An unfortunate Clarinet assignment my 6th grade year of middle school ruined any hope. There was also that one year of handbells. My hunger for learning and understanding new things helped keep my focused.

####Tech Age

I remember when my mom brought home our first NES Console and when my godmother taught me how to type on her Macintosh SE. Computers, video games (including any and all forms of digital entertainment), and developing solutions to overcome digital boundaries became my obsession and by the dawn of the internet I had taught myself the foundations of modern computational processing and technology proved *its fascination* with me. Yes, you read that correctly !

####The Real World

To this point, I have had a fairly random career path both vocationally and academically. I have made some impact as a developer and VP in a couple of Fortune 50â€™s, a contributor and leader in some small to large non-profits, and have a startup under my belt.

####Still Growing

I have been blessed to be able to experience a range of things when it comes to development and programming of things that are important and the organizations that use them and still have *lots of learning left* to do (we will never know everything).

If I tried to count the number of times I have come up short, we'd be here a pretty good while.
