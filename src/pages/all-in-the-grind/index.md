Since the beginning of time man has had a *grind*. A job to do. A certain responsibility to carry.

In more modern terms, grind can mean different things to different people. 

>For me, it relates more to the sense of one pushing his/her self past the physical limitations of their capacity to attain or achieve some type of goal.

Many of us are equally familiar with the phrase **rise and grind**. People who use and apply it understand the importance of being intentional on goal setting and doing whatever it takes to achieve said goals. No matter the circumstances, they push on, in an effort to end up better off than where they began.

There are countless cultural references to *grinding* or *hustling* as we all can attest, no matter our background. Terms used to let someone know you know what you want in life and are willing to make sacrifices, push through struggles and connect with the right type of people in order to reach set goals.

>The key is to ensure we are taking the right approach, using the proper skills and consulting with individuals who can strengthen and not hinder.

There are many in my sector who lack the proper amount of points to map a good picture of the landscape that surrounds them. This often leads to misconceptions and ineffective solutions without a proper understanding of the bigger problems they are facing. Horse blinders so to speak.

Any person with an end goal in mind must focus and not allow anyone or anything to get in the way reaching it. The Internet is a great starting place to research and learn as much as you can to help refine your goals - or set them if you don't have any. A general knowledge of your goal areas will help you become a master of one instead of a jack of all trades. *Shady tree* anyone?

Things will not always be on the upside but we can learn something in any and every situation. Surround yourself with *grinders* well-versed in your areas of passion so that in tough times, you can look to them for advice and encouragement. Trust that your situation is not unique enough to be a new experience that someone else has not encountered before.

I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me... :-)
