<em>The time to learn some programming is here!</em> The development community is buzzing with the announcement that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Apple’s Swift programming language is now open source</a>.

Although the language is not new, it is new to the open source environment. Apple is well known for its Alcatraz like protection and seclusion. It is therefore a rarity to see something so groundbreaking be made publicly available. Many programmers frown at the thought of learning new syntax. But really, what’s one more? Personally, I relish the opportunity to embrace the fear, anxiety and dream-catching that comes with new experiences. Especially when code is involved.

For these reasons and countless others, I urge you even implore you to begin your journey in software development now, starting with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Swift</a>.

Mobile-focused development is not required but will be beneficial given the current trends toward mobile-centric approaches. It’s understood that not everyone fits into this realm and most of the coding is left to the geeks, nerds or those less social. Adding a programming language to your repertoire allows you to stand out from the average professional. A couple of my favorite free resources to get going are: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>, where you can learn to code interactively for free and <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>, founded by Harvard University and MIT in 2012 offering high-quality courses from the world’s best universities and institutions to learners everywhere.

Don’t put it off any longer. No more excuses. <strong>What’s holding you back?</strong>
